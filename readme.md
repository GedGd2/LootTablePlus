# About
LootTablePlus is a plugin created for generating external loot tables for mobs in the Minecraft Universe, allowing server owners, and its players to have fun gameplay whilest keeping it as close as possible to Minecraft's aesthetic without harming the player base requiring them to download external mods and so on.
LootTablePlus was created for as a entry-ticket trial plugin to Candor Service.
LootTablePus was finished under 2 days of work out of the 7 days it was given with 11-12 hours of summerized work. 

# Distribution
This plugin is completely open-source, and im more than happy for anyone to take on a fork/join my team to make better competitive marketing for free software plugins!
as of now, im not looking to make the plugin a premium software plugin or anything to do with purchasing the rights to own a copy, but I do my licensing via MIT protocol for professional causes.

# Compiling
Compilation requires JDK 12 and up.
2 Ways to compiling the plugin:
- run `./gradlew shadowjar` from the terminal executed from your plugin's folder.
- Use your IDE's standard Gradle Integration Tool to build the jar via `Tasks -> Shadow -> ShadowJar` (If you're using **Eclipse** I highly encourage you to make sure all dependencies are queried inside the system, due to Eclipse not being accurate/familiar with external build tools). 
Once the plugin compiles, grab the jar from `~/output` folder.
